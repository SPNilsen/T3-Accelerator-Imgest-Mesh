# Local Dev — Wiring Reference

How the four Imgest-Mesh services connect when running via `docker compose up` from the repo root.

See the top-level `README.md` for the quick-start commands. This doc explains the plumbing.

## How each service is mounted

| Service | Container path | Host path | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| camera | `/opt/camera/output` | `./.data/frames` | emits placeholder frames |
| orchestrator | `/opt/orchestrator/input` | `./.data/frames` | reads camera's output |
| orchestrator | `/opt/orchestrator/output/inference-1` | `./.data/routed` | routes to inference |
| inference | `/opt/inference/input` | `./.data/routed` | reads routed files |
| inference | `/opt/inference/output/json` | `./.data/results/json` | writes pass/fail verdicts |
| inference | `/opt/inference/output/images` | `./.data/results/images` | reserved for future image output |

Same host dir mounted into two containers = the shared channel between stages. Bind-mounting to `./.data/` (instead of named Docker volumes) lets you inspect files from Windows Explorer or VS Code while the pipeline is running.

## Port mapping to host

Host → Container:
- `8080` → webserver (nginx dashboard UI)
- `8081` → camera FastAPI `/healthz` `/status`
- `8082` → orchestrator FastAPI `/healthz` `/status`
- `8083` → inference FastAPI `/healthz` `/status`

The dashboard JS in `resources/webserver/index.html` hardcodes `http://localhost:808[1-3]/status`. That works because browser-side fetches hit Docker Desktop's port mappings directly — not in-container DNS.

**OpenShift implication:** this browser→localhost pattern will NOT work on OpenShift. Before the Cisco demo the webserver must either:
1. Reverse-proxy each service through nginx (recommended), or
2. Each service gets its own OpenShift Route and the dashboard switches to those URLs.

## Inference mode

Currently `mock`. `resources/inference/app/worker.py::run_mock_inference_loop` watches the input dir and writes a JSON verdict (`pass` or `fail`) per file with an 80% pass rate and random confidence in `[0.60, 0.99]`.

Migration path to a real small model (e.g., MobileNetV3 from HuggingFace / ONNX model zoo):

1. Add an env switch `INFERENCE_MODE=mock|model` (default `mock` in dev / CI; `model` in the Cisco demo config)
2. Add a model-loader module that pulls the artifact to a cache volume on first run
3. Replace random verdicts with real inference output + a pass/fail threshold
4. Keep mock mode available for tests and air-gapped scenarios
5. Swap the tiny model for the real Imgest-Mesh inspection model by changing one config value — no code change required

## Troubleshooting

### Services restart-loop with exit 127 on Windows
Symptom in `docker compose logs`:
```
env: 'bash\r': No such file or directory
```
Cause: `*.sh` files were checked out with CRLF line endings. Fix:
```bash
# one-time fix of existing checkout
sed -i 's/\r$//' resources/*/scripts/start.sh
```
The `.gitattributes` at the repo root prevents this for future clones, but
an existing working copy may still need the one-time `sed` pass.

### Build fails with "parent snapshot ... does not exist"
Docker BuildKit cache corruption (common after interrupted builds):
```bash
docker builder prune -f
docker compose build
```

### Port conflicts
Host ports 8080–8083 must be free. On Windows, check with
`Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080` (PowerShell) or
`netstat -ano | findstr 808` (cmd).

## Known gaps / observations

- **Camera emits `.txt`, not real images:** `resources/camera/app/emitter.py::emit_placeholder_frame` writes text stubs. Pillow is in `requirements.txt` but unused. Upgrading to real image emission is part of the inference-model work.
- **`/healthz` is a minimal endpoint** — returns `{"ok": true}` only. Compose healthchecks hit it directly.
- **Inference `storage.image_output_directory` is allocated but unused** — reserved for annotated-image output.
